			Collaborating with her team members, she managed many different projects in Internal Organization, Grant Writing, Marketing, Policy Analysis, and Intellectual Property. 
			
			ViviAnne and her team organized the company’s online documents into a comprehensive format which improved the efficiency and decreased confusion of the rest of the departments. ViviAnne assisted Dr. Waqas to complete a grant proposal with a very immediate deadline. ViviAnne presented multiple competitive market analysis of multiple industries such as EB Lithography and Electric Vehicles. She also researched and consolidated FDA and CBER regulations on Wearable Biosensing Devices, and Neonatal Kidney Dialysis Devices. Finally, ViviAnne led a project with students and teachers outside of the URAP to provide a comprehensive Intellectual Property strategy for Jadoo Technologies Inc. to protect the future of the company.
